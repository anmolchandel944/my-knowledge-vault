    <p>A curated collection of concepts I deeply understand — from math to the cosmos.</p>

  <h2>Reasoning with Uncertainty</h2>
  <p>
    When facts are unknown or noisy —
    I know how AI uses probabilistic models like Bayesian networks
    to infer likely outcomes instead of absolute truths.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>
    The real world isn’t deterministic —
    I understand how AI reasons under uncertainty using probability,
    modeling incomplete information to make the best possible decisions.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>Representing Knowledge in AI</h2>
  <p>
    From propositional logic to knowledge bases —
    I know how AI stores information symbolically
    and reasons about the world using inference algorithms.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>Knowledge in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>
    Intelligence isn’t just searching —
    I understand how AI represents facts, rules, and relationships,
    and uses logical inference to derive new knowledge from what it already knows.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>AI Search & Problem Solving</h2>
  <p>
    From mazes to decision trees —
    I understand how defining states, actions, and goals
    allows AI to systematically search for solutions.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>Search Algorithms in AI</h2>
  <p>
    Problems aren’t solved instantly —
    I know how AI models them as state spaces and navigates them
    using informed and uninformed search strategies.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
  <h2>Search: Finding Solutions in a State Space</h2>
  <p>
    From brute-force exploration to intelligent decision-making —
    I understand how AI searches through possible states using algorithms
    like DFS, BFS, and A* to reach optimal solutions efficiently.
  </p>
</section>

    <section class="card">
         <h2>Infinity Isn’t a Number</h2>
         <p> From Hilbert’s Hotel to limits in calculus, I know why infinity breaks common sense but powers mathematics.</p>
   </section>

   <section class="card">
        <h2>Why Prime Numbers Matter</h2>
        <p>  Not just classroom theory — from cryptography to blockchain, I understand why primes quietly run the digital world.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Discovery of π</h2>
        <p>From Archimedes’ polygons to infinite series and modern computational proofs — I know how humanity cracked this irrational constant.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Space vs Time</h2>
        <p>Space is where things exist. Time is how they change. Together, they form spacetime — bent by gravity in Einstein’s relativity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Black Holes</h2>
        <p>Gravity’s ultimate trap: event horizons, singularities, and Hawking radiation. I understand the physics behind the unseeable.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>
        <p>Particles linked across vast distances — measure one, the other changes instantly. Einstein called it “spooky action.”</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>The Big Bang</h2>
        <p>13.8 billion years ago, everything began in a hot, dense point. CMB, redshift, and element formation tell the story.</p>
